# 📑 GfG 160 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to the **GfG-160daysOfDSA** repository!  
This repository contains my daily solutions and notes for the **[GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/160-days-of-dsa-workshop)**. The challenge covers core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with a focus on solving one problem every day.

This repository is structured to track progress day-by-day, with clear explanations and solutions to help solidify my understanding.

## 🚀 Objective

The objective of this challenge is to:
- Master the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Build problem-solving habits with a consistent daily challenge.
- Improve my coding skills by solving problems from easy to advanced topics.

> 💡 “Consistency beats intensity — one problem at a time.”

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

The structure of this repository follows a day-by-day progression. Each day's problem is stored in its own folder. The folder structure looks like this:

```

GfG-160daysOfDSA/
│
├── Arrays/
│   ├── 1/13. problem_name/
│   │   ├── problem.md
│   │   └── solution.py
│   └── ...
│
├── Strings/
│   ├── 14/20. problem_name/
│   │   ├── problem.md
│   │   └── solution.py
│   └── ...
│
├── .gitignore
└── README.md

````

- **`problem.md`**: Contains the problem statement, examples, explanations, and constraints.
- **`solution.py`**: Contains the Python solution for the problem.

Each day’s folder will contain the problem in Markdown format (`problem.md`) and the solution in Python (`solution.py`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Problem Source:** [GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of DSA](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/160-days-of-dsa-workshop)
- **Tools:** GitHub, Markdown, Python, GeeksforGeeks

## 📝 Problem Format
Each problem is presented with the following structure inside `problem.md`:

1. **Title**: The problem's title, which is a clickable link to the GeeksforGeeks problem page.
2. **Difficulty**: A tag indicating the difficulty of the problem (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
3. **Problem Statement**: The full description of the problem.
4. **Examples**: One or more examples with input, output, and explanation.
5. **Constraints**: A list of constraints for the problem.

## 💻 Solution Format

The solution for each problem is inside `solution.py` and is written in Python. The solution will contain:

* Proper comments explaining each part of the code.
* Code for optimal time and space complexity.
