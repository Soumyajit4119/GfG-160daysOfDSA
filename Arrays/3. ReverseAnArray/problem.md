## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

## 📊 Examples

### ✅ Example 1

```
Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.
```

### ✅ Example 2

```
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.
```

### ✅ Example 3

```
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
```

## 📌 Constraints

- 1<=arr.size()<=105  
- 0<=arr[i]<=105
